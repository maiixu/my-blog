Hihi 👋 I'm **Mai**, a software engineer by profession, a guitarist by passion, and a minimalist at heart. I'm on the way of becoming the parent of two Siberian Cats.

Here are some of my core values:

- 🖐️ Always helping others.
- ✨ Minimalism and Stoicism.
- 📚 Lifelong learning and knowledge sharing.

My educational and personal experiences have shaped my aspiration to effect positive societal change. I aim to craft practical solutions to address real-world issues. I imagine myself doing so in several ways:

- 👷‍♂️ Crafting large-scale and reliable software systems.
- ✍️ Be an influencer. Outputting content that inspires others.
- 🎸 Playing great music pieces.

Beyond software engineering and music, my commitments are wide-ranging. To list but a few:

- 📜 Stories in the form of movies, novels, animation, games, and more. I find joy in exploring character arcs and motives across various forms of storytelling;
- 🖖 Experiences that make me feel alive, such as live music, musicals, jazz bars, concerts, and more;
- 💡 Abstract theories and methodologies fascinate me. This includes books and blogs that dissect life experiences from diverse perspectives, and my interest extends to history and literature;
- 🤩 Embracing cultural diversity and different life experiences through trying new things, making friends from various backgrounds, and occasionally traveling, especially on road trips!
- 🏜️ Nature's company, a source of peace through activities like meditation, running and hiking. I aim to visit every (7/63) national parks!
